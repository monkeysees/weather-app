## Overview

This app is built with `React`. It uses functional components (including state-management hooks such as `useContext` and `useReducer`) and leveerages Typescript with Sass. It also relies on the rich React ecosystem using `React Query` for data-fetching, `React Modal` for search modal, React Hot Toast for notifications and `React Transition Group` for basic CSS animations.

Additionally, the app persists in `localStorage` your last chosen location and temperature unit as well as search history so that your preferences are remembered across the site visits.
